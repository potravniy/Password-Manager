App has three pages: login, register, dashboard (main logged in view).
User can add/edit/delete/reveal password on the dashboard after login.
All password data are stored, so when user reloads pages, it is redirected back to the dashboard and all password are fetched.
By default passwords are hidden with "*", when user clicks the password field it reveals the real password.
Passwords are stored in local storage. It makes app device-oriented.
